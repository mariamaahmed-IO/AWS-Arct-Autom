# AWS-Arct-Autom
##AWS Multi-Tier Architecture with Terraform

## Project Overview
This project provisions a highly available, secure, and scalable multi-tier architecture** on AWS using Terraform**.

It includes:
- VPC with public/private subnets across 3 AZs
- Bastion Host in public subnet
- Application Servers in private subnets behind an ALB
- RDS MySQL database in private subnet
- EFS volume mounted to App Servers
- S3 bucket for log storage
- IAM role for EC2 â†’ S3 access
- Auto Scaling Group with Launch Template
- DNS & HTTPS using Route 53 + ACM
- CI/CD-ready infrastructure

## Structure

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/              # Reusable Terraform modules
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf               # Root module
â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf          # Input variables
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf            # Outputs like public IP, ALB DNS, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ terraform.tfvars      # Project-specific variable values
â”œâ”€â”€ provider.tf           # AWS provider config
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore            # Ignore Terraform state, logs, etc.

## ðŸš€ Prerequisites
AWS CLI installed and configured (`aws configure`)
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Git installed
- SSH key (e.g., `utc-key.pem`)
- A registered domain (for Route 53 & ACM)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-multitier-terraform.git
cd aws-multitier-terraform
```

### 2. Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### 3. Customize variables
Edit `terraform.tfvars` or create one:
```hcl
region        = "us-east-1"
key_name      = "utc-key"
domain_name   = "yourdomain.com"
```

### 4. Validate and plan the infrastructure
```bash
terraform plan
```

### 5. Apply to deploy resources
```bash
terraform apply
```
