- VPC with public and private subnets
- Bastion host
- EC2 instances (App servers)
- Application Load Balancer
- Target Groups
- Auto Scaling Group with Launch Template
- IAM roles
- RDS (MySQL) database
- EFS volume
- S3 backup integration
- Route53 and ACM for HTTPS

## Notes on Security

- `.terraform/`, `.tfstate`, `.tfvars`, `.pem`, and logs are excluded in `.gitignore`.
- No hard-coded credentialsâ€”access handled through AWS IAM roles or environment variables.

## Before pushing

- Add `.gitignore` to exclude `.terraform/`, state files, logs
- Make sure no `.pem` or sensitive files are tracked
- Initialize git repo and connect to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

If `.terraform/` was accidentally committed:

```bash
git rm -r --cached .terraform/
git commit -m "Remove .terraform from repo"
git push origin main --force
```
